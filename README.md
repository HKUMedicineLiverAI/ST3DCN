# ST3DCN
Spatio-Temporal 3D Convolution Network for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

# System requirements
This project is based on Keras + Tensorflow, deployed on the platform with Centos whose version number is CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908 (Core). The hardware information of the server is as below.CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R)  Gold 6146 CPU @ 3.20 GHz, 2 Thread(s) per core, 12 Core(s) per socket, 2 Socket(s)  ---> 48 CPU(s), GPU: 4 Tesla V100 32 GB, RAM Memory: 500 GB. 

The version of Keras (https://keras.io/getting_started/) is 2.11.0, the version of tensorflow-gpu (https://www.tensorflow.org/) is 2.11.0. 
To ensure the successful utilization of GPU computation power, one should install the correct version of GPU driver library first. As for us, the version of cudnn is 8.1.0.77 and the version of cudatoolkit is 11.2.2. One can install tensorflow-gpu and Keras under conda envirnment. Packages of numpy, scipy, panda, opencv, pillow, pydicom, etc, should be installed also.
